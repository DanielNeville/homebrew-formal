homebrew-formal
===============

Homebrew formulas for formal verification and some other related packages
that are missing in the official Homebrew repository


Installation
============

Install Homebrew and then execute the following command:

  $ brew tap mht208/formal


Note
====

Formulas for OCaml packages can also be found in
[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org "OPAM"), which is also included in
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh).
Currently, the latest version of CIL (1.7.3) compiled with the latest
versions of OCaml (4.02.1 and 4.02.0) seems not working on Mac OS X
10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite.
If you want to use CIL, it may be better to use OPAM and switch the
OCaml version to 4.01.0.
